## DATACOL

[Datacol](https://www.datacol.io) provides a powerful control layer on top of AWS/GCP.

Datacol helps you create Heroku like infrastructure for deploying container-native applications on Cloud. It is a deployment platform that simplifies the process developers use to build, deploy and manage their applications in the cloud.

Datacol is installed into your own Cloud account and uses [Container engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/), [GCR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/), [ContainerBuilder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/), and many other great GCP services under the hood but automates it all away to give you a better deployment experience. It uses Docker under the hood so if you want to customize anything (languages, dependencies, etc) you can simply add a Dockerfile to your project.
